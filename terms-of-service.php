</p>
<h3>Third Party
</h3>
<p>Your use of a service provided by a third party to access the Foocall Card Services, including but not limited to your local mobile operator or phone provider ("Provider"), will also be subject to the Provider's terms and conditions. For the avoidance of doubt in using any such Provider service you will still be bound by these Terms of Service in respect of your use of the Foocall Card Services.

<h3>Unauthorized Use/Stolen Card</h3>
<p>If your Card is stolen, lost, damaged or destroyed, or if you become aware of unauthorized use of the Foocall Card Services you may lose any remaining credit and we will not offer any refund. Please note: If you know the Access Number and your card’s PIN then you won’t need the physical card to be able to make calls while you still have credit.</p>
<h3>No Unlawful or Prohibited Use</h3>
<p>You expressly acknowledge and agree to use any Foocall Service solely for lawful purposes. In this respect you may not, without limitation (a) intercept or monitor, damage or modify any communication which is not intended for you, (b) send any unsolicited commercial communication not permitted by applicable law, (c) use any Foocall Card Service in any fraudulent way, (d) expose any third party to material which is offensive, harmful to minors, indecent or otherwise objectionable.</p>

<h3>Use of Foocall Card Services</h3>
<p>FooCall International Calling Cards are pre-paid phone cards of different denominations. To use the service you must call an Access Number (shown on a Foocall Card and this website) and follow the instructions. You will require the PIN number on the back of your Foocall Card to be able to use the service. Calls to an Access Number will cost you your usual rate for a call to a normal 020 number or whichever Access Number you choose to connect to.</p>
<p>You cannot use your FooCall Card to call premium, special rate and some non-geographic numbers.</p>
<h3>Card Activation &amp; Expiry</h3>
<p>A Foocall Card completes its activation by calling an Access Number and entering the PIN number for the first time. At this point, the credit on the card is valid for 90 days. After 90 days, any remaining credit on that card will be lost. For the avoidance of doubt, no refunds are given for unused credit and credit expiry dates cannot be changed.</p>
<h3>Rates</h3>
<p>The rates for the Foocall Card Services are published on the Site. Foocall Card reserves the right to change the rates at any time without notice. The charges for a particular call are calculated by charging the rate to a particular number, by the minute, rounded up to the nearest minute. In addition, there is a four pence connection charge for each call. Call Rates are subject to change at any time. Please see the Foocall Card Rates for up-to-date rate information. All Call Rates include VAT.</p>

<p>You will also pay any additional charges you incur if you connect to the Foocall Card Services through a phone number provided by Foocall while you are in a country that is not the country associated with your fixed or mobile phone Provider ("Roaming Charges"). Roaming Charges are charged in addition to any charges you may incur when connecting to the Foocall Services from another country.</p>
<h3>Refunds &amp; Credits</h3>
<p>Foocall does not provide refunds or credits on balances on your card except as expressly provided for in these terms and where we have breached our obligation to you. For the avoidance of doubt, no other refunds or credits shall be given for Card services paid, except in exceptional circumstances, and at Foocall Card's sole discretion.</p>
<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>Foocall Card is not liable for acts or omissions of another Provider, for information provided through your Device, equipment failure or modification, or causes beyond our reasonable control. We are not liable for service outages or for service limitations or interruptions. We are not liable for any accidents or incidents which result from the use of Foocall Card Services by you or any other person. Our liability and the liability of any underlying Provider for any failure or mistake shall in no event exceed the Foocall Card Services charges during the affected period, up to the price you paid for your Foocall  Card. We and any underlying Provider are not liable for any incidental, punitive or consequential damages such as lost profits. We, and any underlying Provider, are not liable for economic loss or injuries to persons or property arising from the use of the Foocall Card Services. This paragraph shall survive expiration of your Card and any credit.</p>
